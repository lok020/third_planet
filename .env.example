# Example of a .env file for storing sensitive information
# Make sure to replace 'replace_with_your_api_key' with your actual API key.
# You can create a .env file in the same directory as this example
# and copy this content into it.
# Note: Do not commit your .env file to version control systems like Git.
# This file should not be shared publicly or included in version control.
# To use this file, you can load the environment variables in your application
# using a library like dotenv in Python or similar libraries in other languages.
# Ensure that your application is configured to read from the .env file
# and that the file is kept secure and private.
